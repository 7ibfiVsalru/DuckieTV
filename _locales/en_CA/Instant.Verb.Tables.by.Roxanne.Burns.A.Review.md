## Features and Benefits of Instant Verb Tables
 
One of the main advantages of **Instant Verb Tables** is that it is very easy to use. You can simply look up any verb you want to learn or practice in the alphabetical index, and find its corresponding table in the book. Each table shows you how to conjugate the verb in different tenses, moods and persons, as well as its meaning and usage examples. You can also see the irregular forms and common expressions with the verb highlighted in color.
 
Another benefit of **Instant Verb Tables** is that it covers six major languages that are widely spoken and studied around the world. You can use the book to learn verbs in one language, or compare and contrast them across different languages. The book also includes an introduction that explains the basic grammar rules and terminology for each language, as well as a glossary of common verbs and their meanings.
 
A third advantage of **Instant Verb Tables** is that it is very compact and portable. You can easily carry it with you wherever you go, and use it as a quick reference whenever you need to refresh your memory or check your accuracy. The book is also durable and well-designed, with clear fonts and colors, and spiral binding that allows you to flip through the pages easily.
 
## Drawbacks and Limitations of Instant Verb Tables
 
Despite its many benefits, **Instant Verb Tables** also has some drawbacks and limitations that you should be aware of before buying it. One of them is that it only covers 200 verbs per language, which might not be enough for advanced learners who want to expand their vocabulary and master more complex structures. The book also does not provide any exercises or quizzes to help you practice and test your knowledge.
 
Another limitation of **Instant Verb Tables** is that it does not include any audio or visual aids to help you with pronunciation and listening skills. You will have to rely on other sources or tools to improve these aspects of your language learning. The book also does not cover any regional or dialectal variations of the verbs, which might be important for some learners who want to communicate with native speakers from different countries or regions.
 
A third drawback of **Instant Verb Tables** is that it might be too expensive for some learners who are on a tight budget. The book costs around $27 on Amazon[^3^], which might be too much for some people who are looking for a cheaper or free alternative. You can also download a PDF version of the book from the internet[^3^], but you will have to print it yourself or use an electronic device to access it.
