# What is a Hypermill Post Processor File and How to Convert it to EPUB?
 
A post processor file is a file that contains instructions for a computer numerical control (CNC) machine on how to execute a toolpath generated by a computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) software. A post processor file is specific to a certain type of machine and controller, and it ensures that the CNC machine can interpret the toolpath correctly and efficiently.

Hypermill is a CAM software developed by OPEN MIND Technologies, which can calculate toolpaths independently of machine and controller. Hypermill post processor files are files that are generated by Hypermill's postprocessors, which can be customized and optimized for various machines and controllers. Hypermill post processor files have the extension .hpm.
 
EPUB is a file format for electronic books (e-books), which can be read by various devices and applications. EPUB files have the extension .epub, and they contain HTML, CSS, images, fonts, metadata, and other resources that make up an e-book.
 
To convert a Hypermill post processor file to EPUB, you need a software that can read .hpm files and export them as .epub files. One possible software is MecSoft's Post Processor Generator, which can download, edit, create, and export post processor files for different CAM software products, including Hypermill. MecSoft's Post Processor Generator can be downloaded for free from their website[^2^]. Here are the steps to convert a Hypermill post processor file to EPUB using MecSoft's Post Processor Generator:
 
1. Download and install MecSoft's Post Processor Generator.
2. Launch the software and open the .hpm file that you want to convert.
3. Edit the file as needed using the graphical user interface or the script editor.
4. Go to File > Export As > EPUB.
5. Choose a name and location for the .epub file and click Save.

You have now converted a Hypermill post processor file to EPUB. You can open the .epub file with any compatible e-book reader or application.
  
Why would you want to convert a Hypermill post processor file to EPUB? One possible reason is that you want to share your CNC machining knowledge and experience with others in an e-book format. You can use Hypermill post processor files as examples or illustrations of how to program different types of machines and controllers for various machining tasks. You can also add explanations, tips, and tricks to your e-book to make it more informative and engaging.
 
Another possible reason is that you want to learn from other Hypermill post processor files that are available online. You can download post processor files from OPEN MIND Technologies' website or from other sources, and convert them to EPUB to read them on your preferred device or application. You can also compare different post processor files and see how they differ in terms of syntax, logic, and optimization. You can use this as a way to improve your own post processor files or to learn new techniques and methods.
 
Converting Hypermill post processor files to EPUB can be a useful and interesting way to explore the world of CNC machining. Whether you are a beginner or an expert, you can benefit from reading and writing post processor files in an e-book format. You can also share your e-books with others who are interested in learning more about Hypermill and CNC machining.
